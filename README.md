# Feed Reader Project

The Feed Reader project reads from four different RSS Feeds.

* Udacity Blog
* CSS Tricks
* HTML5 Rocks
* Linear Digressions

After the web page loads, a list of feed links related to the Udacity Blog, will be displayed down the page and you can choose to navigate to any one of the links.
To switch between feeds, you can click on the hamburger menu, to choose the new feed.

The functionality for the project was already completed and working. What was omitted was the Jasmine unit tests.

In order to complete the project, a unit test suite was added to the project within the feedreader.js file which tested the core functionality.
